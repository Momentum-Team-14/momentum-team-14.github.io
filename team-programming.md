## üë©‚Äçüíª In-class Project: Team Programming Exercise

We're going to live code together in class using a practice called _mob programming_. This is like pair programming, with more than two people but still only one computer. We create an application as a group, and everyone participates in figuring out how to implement features and writing the code.

## Shifts

The following pattern determines how you change roles at each interval. Your starting role is defined above.

Each round:

- The driver becomes the scout
- The navigator becomes the driver
- The moderator becomes the navigator
- The scout becomes the moderator

With 4 people on your team, you will start over from the beginning on the 5th shift.
