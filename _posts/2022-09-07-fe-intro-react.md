## 🗓️ Today's topics

- Exercism review

## ✅ To Do Before Class

- Continue working on Exercism. I'll take requests for one to work through together in class.
- Need some JS review? Create a list of topics that you would like us to dig into some more and share in class.
- Read | Watch | Listen for today or anything from yesterday that you didn't get to.
- Work on the React tutorial project(s) below.

## 🛠️ Setup

Make sure you have the following set up in your local environment (docs listed below in Resources):

- Node & `npm`
- ESLint for VS Code
- React developer tools for Chrome

### 📖 Read | 📺 Watch | 🎧 Listen

- ⭐ 📖 [React Quick Start (beta docs)](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn) These docs are still being written, so they are incomplete, but what is written is much more helpful than the older offical docs.
- 📖 [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- 📺 [Kent C. Dodds, The Introduction to React You've Been Missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAIdyBFHfVU)
- 🎧 [Syntax.fm podcast: The React Episode](https://syntax.fm/show/066/the-react-episode)
- [An Absolute Beginner's Guide to npm](https://nodesource.com/blog/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-using-npm/) You can skim this -- there is more here than you need.

## 🎯 Project: React Tutorial

[Beginner's Guide to React Tutorial](https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react-2020/). This is a really friendly total beginner tutorial that will show you the most modern way to build React apps.

[This link will create an empty repo on GitHub that you can use to push your tutorial code to.](https://classroom.github.com/a/BlNTHud7).

If you finish this and want to keep going, try one of these other tutorials:

- [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) - video-driven, intense and very complete
- [The official React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) - classic, official. Uses class-based components, which are a bit older, but still widely used
- [Dave Ceddia's React tutorial](https://daveceddia.com/react-getting-started-tutorial/) - very long, very comprehensive, but still pretty accessible
