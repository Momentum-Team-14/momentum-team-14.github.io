### ‚≠ê EXTRA/TMI

Fetch requests use JavaScript **promises** to handle responses. Promises are a _much_ bigger topic than we will get into right now, but if you want to know more about what a promise is and how to use it beyond the context of AJAX requests, you can start with the MDN documentation about it.
