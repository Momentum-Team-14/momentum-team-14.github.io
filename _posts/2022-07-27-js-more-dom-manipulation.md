### ‚≠êÔ∏è EXTRA/TMI

This resource is really not at all necessary to understand or do the project, _but_ if you want to know more about the concept of tree structures in computer science, check out this piece from [Vaidehi Joshi's BaseCS blog series](https://medium.com/basecs). She is awesome! There is also a thoroughly delightful accompanying [BaseCS podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs) with the equally amazing Saron Yitbarek.

And here is more info about what is happening when a browser renders a page -- very enlightening, although not strictly necessary at this stage:

- [About the browser rendering engine](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/#The_rendering_engine)
- [How browser rendering works](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-browser-rendering-works-behind-the-scenes-6782b0e8fb10/)

This is a good explanation about how JS events "bubble" up the chain of elements on the page:

If you would like to know more about the JavaScript Event Loop and how it works, I highly recommend this resource. Don't miss the video of the conference talk that goes along with it -- it's excellent:
