## 🎯 Project: DRF Tutorial

Complete [the official Django REST Framework tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/). You may find it easier going if you follow [the guide by Will Vincent](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/official-django-rest-framework-tutorial-beginners).

Will Vincent uses the exact same code and steps but is much more beginner-friendly. He also uses `pipenv` for the virtual environment like we do. Will's tutorial stops short of the last step, [step 6](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/6-viewsets-and-routers/), in the official tutorial. If you finish step 5 and want to keep going, you can [continue with the official tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/6-viewsets-and-routers/), but this is not required.

You should complete the tutorial **by tomorrow**. [This assignment link](https://classroom.github.com/a/s2lxIoxg) generates an empty repo that you can use to push your completed tutorial to.

⛔ **Do not copy & paste the code**. You'll get a lot more out of the tutorial if you type it out yourself.
