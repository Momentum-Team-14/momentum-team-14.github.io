## 📖 Read | 📺 Watch | 🎧 Listen

_These are required readings, videos, and/or podcasts. Read, watch, or listen, and **take notes**._

- ⭐ 📖 [Modern JavaScript Explained for Dinosaurs](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70) -> This is essential for context.
- 📖 [State of JS 2021 Survey Results](https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/) -> This is actually data collected in 2022. Skim for an overview of current trends in the JS ecosystem.
- 📺 [ES6 tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZQc7RUAg18)
- 📺 [Modern JavaScript for Django Developers](https://2021.djangocon.us/talks/modern-javascript-for-django-developers/)
- 📖 [Modern JavaScript for Django Developers](https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/modern-javascript-for-django-developers/) - this is the blog post version of the above talk. **Read the first two parts only**:
    - [Part 1: Organizing your Front-End Codebase in a Django Project](https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/modern-javascript-for-django-developers/client-server-architectures/)
    - ⭐[Part 2: A Crash Course in Modern JavaScript Tooling](https://www.saaspegasus.com/guides/modern-javascript-for-django-developers/javascript-tooling/) -- this is a complement to the first article on this list.


## 🎯 To Do

1. Review the code in [JavaScript You Need to Know for React](https://github.com/Momentum-Team-14/notes/blob/main/js-for-react.md). You'll need to be able to read and use the JS in these notes to work with React effectively. **It would be valuable practice to type out the examples and run them yourself.**

2. Complete **at least two exercises** from this list on [Exercism.io JavaScript Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript). You're encouraged to work together!

- Isogram
- Scrabble Score
- ETL
- Simple Cipher
- Hamming
- Gigasecond
- Grade School

**Read the tests** provided with each exercise by clicking on the Tests tab in the editor (or opening the test file if you are using the CLI). The tests will show you _exactly_ how the function you're supposed to write will be called and with what arguments.

💫 **PRO TIPS**: When you run the tests, only focus on ONE test at a time. Write code that will get that test -- and ONLY that test -- passing. Then, when you have one passing test, look at the next failing test. Again, just that one! Write code to pass this test. This may require you to _rewrite_ the code you just wrote to pass the first test. That's ok. Writing code like this is called Test-Driven Development (TDD) and it's a useful skill to practice. **One test at a time, try to keep previously tests passing, read the test results each time _carefully_, and _be patient_.**

If you get through two, keep going! More practice is better.

Please come to our class meeting with either/both of the following:

- a solution you got working
- a question about something that blocked your progress

- [MDN: A Re-Introduction to JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
- [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/) -> This is a solid and comprehensive reference with topics clearly labeled.
- [Clean Code: JavaScript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) -> "Clean Code" is a concept popularized by a book of the same name by Robert C. Martin. It means code that is easy to understand and easy to change. This guide applies these concepts to show you how to write clear and maintainable JavaScript. This is something that you will pick up as you go along, so don't worry about "following the rules." The rules are subjective and open to interpretation (as this guide shows). But it's good to know that standards for code exist and developers are commonly expected to conform to them.
